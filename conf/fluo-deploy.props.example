[apps]
###
# This section is used to configure Fluo applications which are indentified by a unique application
# name (which replaces <app> below).  Each test has the following configuration settings:
#
# <app>.repo                # Git repo containing code for test. It is cloned when the test is run.
# <app>.branch              # Branch to checkout in git repo
# <app>.command.pre.init    # Command in test repo to run before initializing and starting Fluo.
#                           # FLUO_HOME & FLUO_APP_NAME will be set in env when run.  This command
#                           # can do things like change fluo config and copy observers
# <app>.command.post.start  # Test script to run from test repo after Fluo is started
#
# Applications can be run using the following command 'fluo-deploy run -a <app>`
# Arguments can be added after <app> and will be passed to configured commands for that app.
# Any files or directories referenced by arguments must exist on leader node.

# Stress test application
# Usage: fluo-deploy run -a stress
# Notes: - Stress test can take up to one hour to complete
# 			 - Status will be output to console
# 			 - Logs are written to install/tests/stress/logs
stress.repo=https://github.com/fluo-io/fluo-stress
stress.branch=master
stress.command.pre.init=bin/configure-fluo.sh 
stress.command.post.start=bin/run-test.sh

# Phrasecount application
# Usage: fluo-deploy run -a phrasecount <txtDocsDir>
# Notes: - The directory <txtDocsDir> must exist on leader node
#        - Cluster cannot be set up with multiple zookeepers until FLUO-521 is resolved.

[nodes]
# Describes nodes in cluster in the following format: 
# <Hostname> = <Service1>[,<Service2>,<Service3>]
# Where: 
#   Hostname = Must be unique.  Will be used for hostname in EC2 or should match hostname on your own cluster
#   Service = Service to run on node (possible values: zookeeper, namenode, resourcemanager, accumulomaster, worker, fluo, graphite, dev)
#             All services are required below except for fluo, dev, & graphite which are optional
leader1 = namenode,zookeeper,fluo,dev
leader2 = resourcemanager,zookeeper
leader3 = accumulomaster,zookeeper
monitor = graphite
worker1 = worker
worker2 = worker
